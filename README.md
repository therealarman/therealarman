# Hi there, I'm Arman ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Data Science student in the Florida Atlantic University Honors College whoâ€™s a lover of programming and all kinds of making! Iâ€™m interested in generative neural networks and AI for the use of medical imaging.

Iâ€™m fluent in Python, C#, and C++, and actively learning Javascript, HTML, and CSS. Always looking to learn and collaborate on interesting projects! Contact me at therealarman@gmail.com
